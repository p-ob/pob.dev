My name is Patrick O'Brien. I'm a software engineer based in the Milwaukee area. This site represents my personal thoughts and opinions, and serves to document my learnings and growth in the field, as well as other personal interests.

## Professional life and focus

I've been a software engineer of varying levels since 2015. In that time, I've dabbled with many technologies, but my passion is in the web ecosystem. I'm currently an engineering manager, but am consistently "in the trenches", still scratching that engineering itch when I can.

If you, too, are in technology, follow along to read about my musings on many topics, including:

- Building lean, performant web applications with modern web primitives and technologies
- How teams can work together to build great software in new and exciting ways
- My thoughts on the industry and where it's headed

## Personal life

As I mentioned earlier, I currently reside in the Milwaukee area. I'm a huge Tolkien nerd, collecting various editions of his works and trying to (re)read them when I can find the time. I'm also a father to a lovable oaf of a Bernese Mountain Dog (Pippin) -- I'm sure he'll make some cameos elsewhere in my site.

When I'm not working, I'm usually playing some video game or another. My guilty pleasure is League of Legends, but I play all sorts, primarily sandbox/survival games. Check out [my games list](/lists/games) to see what I'm currently playing.

I also regularly find myself binging/following closely on many TV shows. Check out [my TV list](/lists/tv) to see what I'm currently watching.
